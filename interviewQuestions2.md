1. What are the differences between a Class and a Struct?
    - Classes and Structs differ in C# in a few different ways:
        - Structs cannot have a default (parameter-less) constructor
        - Structs are value types
        - Classes are reference types
        - Structs do not utilize inheritance
2. When and where is the ```finally``` keyword used?
    - The ```finally``` keyword is used after a sequence of ```try``` and ```catch``` blocks
    - A ```finally``` block executes after the previous blocks are finished
3. Name some properties of an array.

        - ```IsSynchronized```
        - ```Length```
        - ```LongLength```
        - ```Rank```
        - ```SyncRoot```
4. What is an escape sequence? Name some String escape sequences.
    - Escape sequences are used to specify text-based actions in terminals and printers

        - ```\r```: carriage return
        - ```\\```: backslash
